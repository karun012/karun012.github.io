Karun Ramakrishnan, April 15 2022
I love watching movies far too much. There are times I watch some movies multiple times. For instance, I’ve watched Rajinikanth’s Sivaji over 25 times and I still enjoy it. There are times when some movies turn out to be crap. I wanted to start explaining what I understood from such movies and to spark debates around them.

In the nine odd years of software engineering that I have done, I have learned to use feature toggles for code branch control. Yes, I’m talking about dynamically controlling which code gets executed in production using an incredibly simple technique. I have used this in a lot of personal projects, too. It works!

Coming from a Java background, my first taste of functional programming was in Haskell. Yup! That super scary language. It’s so concise that you barely have to write code :P. Back in the day I did some fairly hardcore Haskell programming and to this day I think everyone who wants to learn programming should learn Haskell just to understand the beauty of pure functional programming. The barrier to entry with Haskell is extremely high. It takes a while to become productive.

I once heard a very good statement - I go about my life using my own compass of what is right or wrong. What is right or wrong comes from the experiences I have had in life and how I think our society should work. That to me has been one of the best statements ever and I have tried to live by it.

I feel developers need to get really good at using tools. I started off using Eclipse, but eventually got over it and started using Intellij IDEA. I have been a Vim guy and have not had a chance to learn Emacs. For a while I did use the Vim plugin in Intellij. It works great, but once you start using the in-built features of Intellij, you will see that it is a very powerful tool.

These are some of the principles I really like to follow -
Write tests before writing code unless there is no logic in your code. If there is no test then there should be no code. If you write the test after you write the code, you most likely will be testing behavior and not what you intended to code Write clear, clean, and concise code that works no matter what Do not try to cure a global pandemic while writing a little feature. The business need for that will be part of a different story if it can be afforded Yes, O(n^2) vs O(n) vs O(log n) vs O(n log n) matters! It’s not enough if the code looks pretty Think about costs. If your beautiful code goes live and ends up wasting a million dollars for nothing, it’s not great Learn to use the powers of the IDE. It doesn’t cost $199 for nothing Always think about the code you are writing. At least twice. Maybe even three times if you can afford it. Check, double check and triple check if you can It’s essential to have graceful degradation. Broken software results in angry users Do not reinvent the wheel because you want to, but also do not add a huge library for 3 lines of logic The half - Be nice. It is important! (This is the half because it has nothing to do with the principles above. But it’s still important!)</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2020-08-01 11:00:00 -0700 -0700'>August 1, 2020</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;2 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;252 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Karun Ramakrishnan</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to My nine and a half commandments" href=https://www.karun.dev/posts/nine-and-a-half-commandments/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>Premature abstraction</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>TL;DR - Stick to something like the rule of three. Premature abstraction in any system is almost always going to be problematic, expensive and frustrating. Never add abstractions because you “might” need it in the future. Add it when you “really” need it
Abstraction is a good way of hiding complexity. In your software development life, you probably have created well rounded abstractions that made your life easier. While abstractions make things cleaner and easier to work with, premature abstraction will have the opposite effect.

TDD was something new to me about 8 years ago. I worked as a test automation engineer for a large corporation during my internship. My job was to automate integration tests. When I became a full time developer and starting writing production code, I learned about TDD. I realized that it’s one of the best tools that I had ever come across. Since then my mantra has been red-green-refactor. I have met newer engineers who ask the question - why test it if it works?
