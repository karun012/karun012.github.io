At least the software ones did. Now, I&rsquo;ve worked remotely for over 2.5 years back in 2015. This was across several timezones, too. So it was a little more complicated than what you&rsquo;re probably doing right now. It also involved pair programming. Yeah, it was not simple at all. After a point I did start working regular hours and went solo.</p><p>Back in the day we used Screenhero, which was later bought by <a href=https://www.slack.com/>Slack</a>. It remained as a Slack offering for a long time and then they decided to <a href=https://blog.screenhero.com/post/166784491566/screenhero-is-now-built-into-slack>shut it down</a>. At the moment we use <a href=https://www.tuple.app/>Tuple</a> as our pairing platform.</p><p>Communication is key when you&rsquo;re remote. When in the same office or even the same building, it&rsquo;s way easier to communicate. This is true for a lot of people. Remote introduces a lag in communication. You can never get answers right away. We had a fun experience with the tool that we use. It, by default, took over Mac&rsquo;s notifications and turned on do not disturb when we started screen share sessions. For the longest time we were wondering why we stopped getting Slack notifications. Eventually we found the setting that caused this and learned that it was on by default. When you&rsquo;re remote, always pay attention to your team&rsquo;s communication software. It gets increasingly frustrating when you ask a question and not get an answer for hours.</p><p>One of the problems that I&rsquo;ve not found a good solution for is taking turns while talking in a meeting. When I was many time zones away, of course, there was more lag in video/audio than what we have now. The hardest thing to do is to get attention of people in the meeting room. Now that everyone is remote, it&rsquo;s just a different kind of problem. The lag has probably reduced, but it&rsquo;s still something that I haven&rsquo;t worked out how best to do. This could be a simple solution or who knows, it might be a product that people will subscribe to if we build it.</p><p>Speaking of meetings, an interesting product idea would be a plugin for remote meeting software to vote on story points. It would be fantastic if you could just overlay everyone&rsquo;s votes on their video streams. Something I&rsquo;ve been meaning to build, but haven&rsquo;t had the drive for. Product owners will love something like this when they have to put points on a story. If you&rsquo;re a product owner or someone who would like a product like this, reach out!</p><p>Other than communication, I believe that everything can be fairly easily solved. Companies will have to invest more in technology for keeping the communication going. Faster internet will definitely help. The one problem we won&rsquo;t be able to solve will be the lack of social interaction. Well, here&rsquo;s hoping that remote work ends sometime next year and we can all finally go back into the office.</p></div><footer><div id=hyvor-talk-view></div><script type=text/javascript>var HYVOR_TALK_WEBSITE=1642;var HYVOR_TALK_CONFIG={url:false,id:false};</script><script async type=text/javascript src=//talk.hyvor.com/web-api/embed></script></footer></article><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script><script type=text/javascript async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js></script><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/startup.js id=MathJax-script></script><script>MathJax={tex:{inlineMath:[['$','$'],['\\(','\\)']],processEscapes:true,processEnvironments:true},options:{skipHtmlTags:['script','noscript','style','textarea','pre']}};</script></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
