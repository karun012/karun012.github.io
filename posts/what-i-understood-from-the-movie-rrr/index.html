I love watching movies far too much. There are times I watch some movies multiple times. For instance, I&rsquo;ve watched Rajinikanth&rsquo;s Sivaji over 25 times and I still enjoy it. There are times when some movies turn out to be crap.

I wanted to start explaining what I understood from such movies and to spark debates around them.\nNTR Jr starts out on a rescue mission to find a child from his tribe who was taken by a British couple since she was a tattoo artist (not sure how you’re licensed at that age). Ram Charan is trying to arm his entire clan with guns since his father told him – Load, Aim, Shoot. He joins the British Indian police force so that one day he can steal a single consignment of guns. I think he could have easily stolen the rifles that he eventually tries to steal without having to go through the police academy and all the promotions required to finally get there. Anyhow, Ram Charan, to get a promotion, goes on a hunt for NTR Jr with no explanation of whom he is hunting. Without knowing that it’s him they become wonderful friends when a train almost crashes over a fisherman child’s head, and they rescue him just by using hand signals, a rope, a bike, a horse, and a flag. Lots of child labor in this movie BTW. NTR Jr wants to get into Scott castle where his mission lies. To achieve that, he figures out that there is a lovely lady that he has to befriend. Now that they are friends, NTR Jr explains that he has to befriend the lady. Ram Charan uses hundreds of rusty nails to flatten the lady’s car’s tires. Lady asks NTR Jr for a ride to the market, somehow falls in love with him during those ten minutes and invites him to a party. Both our heroes go to the party and a dance-off ensues. Seeing that the lady wants NTR Jr to win, Ram Charan gives up. Lady invites him to the castle for tea, when she offers to give him a ride since he won the dance-off. NTR Jr meets the abducted child at the castle, who makes so much noise and yet does not alert the guards. He tells her that he will be back for her.\nNTR Jr decides to storm the castle the next night. Ram Charan figures out that NTR Jr was the one that he was hunting while he lies on a bed bitten by a snake whose venom almost kills him, but for which NTR Jr has a homemade antidote. They storm the castle with a truck full of tigers, deer and other animals. Ram Charan gains enough strength to do his boxing training meanwhile and shows up at the castle in a burning four horse-driven carriage. He fights NTR Jr, finally arrests him and throws him in jail to receive his promotion. Then he writes to Alia Bhatt and decides to rescue NTR Jr from death penalty. During his rescue mission, Scott finds out what is happening. The forces go after Ram Charan and NTR Jr. NTR Jr kicks Ram Charan in the face and almost kills him, but manages to escape with the tattoo artist.\nNow Ram Charan gets thrown in jail in the solitary confinement cell. NTR Jr meets Alia Bhatt who explains Ram’s mission. NTR Jr decides to go on another rescue mission for Ram Charan. Our lovely Brit lady appears out of nowhere and shows him the prison’s blueprints for a brief moment. He uses the same beat that they used in the dance off to find the right cell, rips open the door and carries an injured Ram over his shoulder. Ram becomes NTR Jr’s arms. Could’ve used stealth to rescue him, but why are we talking logic here. Anyhow, they end up in the forest, Ram with a broken leg that NTR Jr fixes using the juice of some leaves. Special forces almost kill NTR Jr while he drinks water from a lake, but Ram shows up with unlimited arrows and a bow, leg fully fixed in a matter of minutes. Thirty minutes of fighting later, Scott’s lady dies. Ram gives NTR Jr a gun and says the same thing his father told him – Load, Aim, Fire. Scott dies. They get a bigger consignment of guns to Ram’s clan. NTR Jr ends up with his British lady love.\nSee how logical the whole story was? This is what I understood from SS Rajamouli’s RRR. Maybe I need to watch it again, but I’ve already wasted so much time in life that I do not want to risk it. I hope you love the movie.\nPS: Decent visual effects, but I think the director needs to give up on his Prince of Persia scenes that he has stuck to since Baahubali 2\n","wordCount":"837","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-04-16T07:00:00+05:30","dateModified":"2022-04-16T07:00:00+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Karun Ramakrishnan"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.karun.dev/posts/what-i-understood-from-the-movie-rrr/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Karun Ramakrishnan","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.karun.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.karun.dev/ accesskey=h title="Karun Ramakrishnan (Alt + H)">Karun Ramakrishnan</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://www.karun.dev/posts/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.karun.dev/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.karun.dev/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://www.karun.dev/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://www.karun.dev/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">What I understood from the movie - RRR</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-04-16 07:00:00 +0530 +0530'>April 16, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;837 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Karun Ramakrishnan</div></header><div class=post-content><blockquote><p>There is way more logic in any of Nityananda&rsquo;s speeches than SS Rajamouli&rsquo;s RRR</p><p>Karun Ramakrishnan, April 15 2022</p></blockquote><p>I love watching movies far too much.
