The only intention here is to make fun of this whole process. Take it with a grain of salt and don&rsquo;t be offended.</p><p>In the world of arranged marriages the first fairly common question you&rsquo;ll get asked is - How much money do you make? The big thing about income is - because I make X, I&rsquo;m only open to speaking to someone who makes something greater than X. This happens both to women and men.</p><p>While I find this question to be a red flag and I don&rsquo;t talk further if I hear that right at the beginning, I have decided to try my best to help people out to better figure out financial status of a potential match. Income will not tell you much about a person. All the income might be going towards their current debt or their wine collection or some other hobby. It&rsquo;s also not a very interesting financial indicator until you factor in taxes, living expenses, etc.</p><p>For a very long time everyone has been asking just for income. Instead, you should get creative and analyze financial health/status using more interesting metrics -</p><p>Net-worth without illiquid assets - for those of you who don&rsquo;t know, illiquid assets cannot be converted to cash very easily. They may have a giant island lying around somewhere or a Ferrari California, but it&rsquo;s not easy to sell. So factor that into your calculations. Most hobby related assets will also be illiquid</p><p>Relative wealth index - this will tell you how much the person is using out of their income to build their current lifestyle using consumable assets. Net worth / consumable assets. They can increase it by increasing their net worth or reducing their consumable assets. This will help you find out how easily lifestyle can be upgraded</p><p>Savings-to-income-ratio - this is how much they save every month from the income they make. It&rsquo;s a better indicator of how quickly and easily you can change the relative wealth index</p><p>Total passive income - in case you wish the other person to quit their job, this will be a useful metric to know because regular monthly income will not be around anymore :P</p><p>Thanks to <a href=https://bassamsalem.com/2013/09/22/personal-finance-kpis/>https://bassamsalem.com/2013/09/22/personal-finance-kpis/</a> - for some of these KPIs</p><p>I urge all matrimonial sites to add these KPIs instead of annual income :P</p></div><footer></footer></article><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script><script type=text/javascript async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js></script><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/startup.js id=MathJax-script></script><script>MathJax={tex:{inlineMath:[['$','$'],['\\(','\\)']],processEscapes:true,processEnvironments:true},options:{skipHtmlTags:['script','noscript','style','textarea','pre']}};</script></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
