I never told anyone or wrote about it because I have this feeling that when I say something about things I do or things I like, I somehow stop doing it. I think it&rsquo;s time to put that silly thought aside and talk about this sport that I love. So yes, I do bike. I got into this addictive sport about 6 years ago thanks to Cadence90 in Bangalore, India. Officially I&rsquo;ve ridden roughly around 22000 kilometers. Rides during Covid have all been recorded but discarded. So maybe a few thousand kilometers more. Well this post is not about stats.</p><p>Climbing is a very addictive thing in cycling. It comes with constant suffering, but once you start enjoying it, there is no going back. There are some incredible climbers in this area. It&rsquo;s not about the bike most of the times. It&rsquo;s just the rider when it comes to climbing. Of course a light bike will help you quite a bit, but I&rsquo;ve seen people climb using beach cruisers.</p><p>I was riding up the famed Yerba Buena road this Saturday and thought I&rsquo;d write about it. There wasn&rsquo;t anything interesting this time, but this is one of the climbs where I had to be rescued by a friend last year because I was stupid enough to take on it after a break of about 4 months. It happens to be one of my favorite climbs off of the Pacific Coast Highway. Second to Latigo canyon I think. I mean, if you&rsquo;re in SoCal and if you do not like Latigo, come on! Yerba is a 12.8 kilometer climb with a 708 meter elevation gain at an average gradient of 5.3%. It is a fantastic climb that you should not miss. The views are extremely pretty especially now. There are definitely other canyons in the area that are far tougher and more technical than Yerba, but in many ways it is a very satisfying climb. Circle X Ranch is a good place to stop. One thing I really like about this climb is it does not aim to hurt you as much as say, Decker canyon. But you do have to be very careful if you are doing a longer ride and have Yerba as your road to get back home.</p><p>Years ago Yerba had the worst descent towards Mullholand. I always had flats on that descent. The roads were redone a while ago and it&rsquo;s a joy to descend now. The descend towards Pacific Coast Highway has been pretty good. Not as technical as Decker or Latigo. The only thing to watch out for are rocks. They can scare the crap out of you if you&rsquo;re not used to them. Two things you&rsquo;ll learn descending these canyons is braking and body position. At some point I do wish to get disc brakes because at the moment my primary bike has this rear brake that just has an on/off feel to it. There is not much of a gradual braking. Well, it&rsquo;s certainly stupid to take an areo bike up a climb, so that one is on me :P</p><p>Oh, so I&rsquo;ve never had good phone coverage on this road. At least not until Circle X. 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, 6G, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p><p>Welp! It&rsquo;s time to cook! Cheers!</p></div><footer></footer></article><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script><script type=text/javascript async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js></script><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/startup.js id=MathJax-script></script><script>MathJax={tex:{inlineMath:[['$','$'],['\\(','\\)']],processEscapes:true,processEnvironments:true},options:{skipHtmlTags:['script','noscript','style','textarea','pre']}};</script></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
