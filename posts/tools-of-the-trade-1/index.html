Extend selection selects blocks of code. On the Mac it is bound to Cmd + W. It’s not only useful for selecting, but you can navigate a lot better with this. If your cursor is at the beginning of a block of code, it is easy to use extend selection to select the entire block of code and do things with the selection. If you are pointing at an open paren, you can very easily extend selection to the close paren and navigate to the end with the right arrow key. You can do a ton of more things once you start getting used to it. The opposite of this is shrink selection. It is bound to Cmd + Shift + W.\nI will not show you a video or a gif.
