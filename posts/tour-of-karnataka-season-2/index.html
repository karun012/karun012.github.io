A lot of people immediately signed up and we were all pretty excited.</p><h3 id=nov-15-2016--630-pm-cadence90-jayanagar-bangalore>Nov 15, 2016 – 6:30 PM, Cadence90, Jayanagar, Bangalore</h3><p>Everyone showed up for the briefing. The mood was festive. Chethan was there, talking to everyone about the tour, and then we were given our goodie bags. It had a really neat jersey by <a href=https://www.keepapace.com/>Apace</a>, a box of dry fruit bars from <a href=https://www.ridepositive.com>Ridepositive.com</a>, energy bars from <a href=https://ontherun.in/>On The Run</a>, electrolyte tablets from <a href=http://fastandup.in/>Fast & Up</a>, and cue cards for each day. I had taken the day off and was at Cadence90 since morning. It was really exciting.</p><h3 id=nov-16-2016--630-am-nelamangala-bangalore>Nov 16, 2016 – 6:30 AM, Nelamangala, Bangalore</h3><p>We got off the bus, unloaded the cycles, posed for a few photos, and started off towards Hassan. A hundred and fifty kilometer ride. A little peloton of about 9 riders formed immediately. Once we attained the discipline we were flying towards the destination. Breakfast was served at Swathi Delicacy which is about fifty kilometers from Nelamangala. We got to catch up with all the new people. Lunch was at the hundred and twenty kilometer mark. In the words of Gordon Ramsay – beautiful Bisi Bele Bath with yoghurt was served. Some of us left from the lunch point immediately, and kept moving towards the destination. The first group of riders finished day one in under 5 hours.</p><p>We spent the rest of the day chilling out, and catching up with everyone. To me, day one has always been about speed, and team work. Last year I was riding alone, but this year I was riding with the pack. I’ve seen both sides of it. In my opinion Hassan highway is one of the best roads to ride on. Some of us even call it our home turf. Everyone tells me there are coconut plantations on both sides of the road after a certain point, but how would I know? I only look at my Garmin. Hehe.</p><h3 id=nov-17-2016--630-am-mayura-international-hassan>Nov 17, 2016 – 6:30 AM, Mayura International, Hassan</h3><p>Day two. The day when we were going to climb from Kottigehara to Kalasa. We set off from Hassan towards Belur. The roads were pretty neat. Lots of greenery and colors. Good coffee/tea wherever we stopped. Beautiful weather most of the times.</p><p>The first stop was at Belur. It has been our customary breakfast point. We waited for everyone to arrive, had breakfast, and set off towards Kalasa. The ride from Belur to Kottigehara was pretty relaxing. The challenge was after the lunch point. We had lunch by noon, waited for everyone to get ready, and started riding towards Kalasa. There were three really good climbs from Kottigehara. I saw a couple of our riders go past me, and that was it. I decided to slow down, and was riding alone. After finishing the first two climbs I stopped to get a drink, but nothing was available where I stopped. So I set off again towards Kalasa. The destination was Silent Valley Resorts, Kalasa. A bunch of riders had finished and were sipping the welcome drink. Of course I had a few welcome drinks. Hehe.</p><p>The resort was very beautiful. As the name suggests, it was really silent, and it was in a valley. Incredible food, and very comfortable villas to stay in. We started unwinding, spent the rest of the evening having fun, and went to bed at around 11 PM.</p><h3 id=nov-18-2016--730-am-silent-valley-resorts-kalasa>Nov 18, 2016 – 7:30 AM, Silent Valley Resorts, Kalasa</h3><p>We were all looking forward to this day because we were going to be riding through the Kudremukh national forest. Yes! You read it right.</p><p>The ride through the Kudremukh forest was blissful. We all started together at the entry check post and rode in groups to be very safe. Our main man, Chethan Ram, had all the paperwork taken care of. There were lots of climbs and one incredible downhill of about ten kilometers. It was thrilling. We regrouped at the end of the forest area, and headed towards Malpe. Kudremukh to Malpe was a real challenge. The sun was beating down on us, and the tarmac was getting hotter, and hotter as every minute passed. I got dropped at one point. Eventually I caught up with the group, and we reached the Udupi highway. It was a breeze once we reached the highway. By 4:30 PM a few of the riders had reached the destination – Paradise Isle Beach Resort, Malpe. It is by far one of the best resorts in that area.</p><p>We partied through the evening, had a lot of fun, and then relaxed. The final day was just a few hours away.</p><h3 id=nov-19-2016--700-am-paradise-isle-beach-resort-malpe>Nov 19, 2016 – 7:00 AM, Paradise Isle Beach Resort, Malpe</h3><p>This was our recovery ride. A relaxed ride to Kundapura and back. We ate the famous Kotte Kadubu at the twenty five kilometer mark, and headed towards Kundapura. The final train rode very quickly to Kundapura. I slowed down after we turned back towards Udupi.</p><p>There was a surprise waiting for us once we got off of the highway. After a few kilometers on the side roads towards Delta Point, our destination, we hit this beautiful road where we had the sea on the left side, and a river on the right. It couldn’t get any better than that. Everyone was waiting at the finish line, cheering each rider as they arrived, and clicking pictures. We were all asked to speak on Facebook live. A lot of pictures were taken, and then we boarded the bus to go to Paradise Lagoon Beach Resort. Everyone’s face had that contented look.</p><p>We received our mementos at the resort, and had our pictures taken.</p><p>…and then the parteh started. We had loads of fun way into the night.</p><p>Tour of Karnataka, what an experience! It’s one of the best tours I’ve been to. The people are amazing. We have some extremely strong riders, and great support staff. At this point I would like to thank the team at Cadence90 for organizing such a beautiful tour. Stop by the store and meet the incredible people there.</p><p>Thanks again to Cadence90, the sponsors, our photographer, the riders, our support staff, and everyone involved.</p></div><footer></footer></article><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script><script type=text/javascript async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js></script><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/startup.js id=MathJax-script></script><script>MathJax={tex:{inlineMath:[['$','$'],['\\(','\\)']],processEscapes:true,processEnvironments:true},options:{skipHtmlTags:['script','noscript','style','textarea','pre']}};</script></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
