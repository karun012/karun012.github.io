Today, after almost eight years of writing Scala code, I think I&rsquo;m ready to say that it&rsquo;s one of the best JVM languages.</p><p>Coming from a Java background, my first taste of functional programming was in Haskell. Yup! That super scary language. It&rsquo;s so concise that you barely have to write code :P. Back in the day I did some fairly hardcore Haskell programming and to this day I think everyone who wants to learn programming should learn Haskell just to understand the beauty of pure functional programming. The barrier to entry with Haskell is extremely high. It takes a while to become productive.</p><p>Now Scala on the other hand is very forgiving. Since it has the OO parts of Java and almost all functional concepts, it makes programming a joy. The more hardcore functional aspects need some external dependencies, but you probably don&rsquo;t need those for the most part. There are some really hardcore parts of Scala that will make you very confused, but overall it&rsquo;s probably the only JVM language that I really love. Clojure is cool, too. Here&rsquo;s hoping Dotty and the future of Scala will make it even better and more widely adopted.</p><p>IDEs like Intellij have gotten better with Scala. The refactoring ability with Java code is so good with Intellij that a lot of day to day tasks become really easy. With Scala it&rsquo;s a little harder, but it&rsquo;s already pretty concise, so it should not be that big of a problem. It has definitely caught up compared to what it was in 2015.</p><p>If I was asked to pick a single JVM language to program in for the rest of my life while being stranded on an island in the middle of the Pacific, it will be Scala.
If I had to pick a single non-JVM language, it will be Haskell.</p><p>What would you pick?
