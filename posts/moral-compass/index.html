It&rsquo;s weirdly cold in Los Angeles today. It&rsquo;s those four days of winter that we get. Just watched a good video that someone I know sent me that talks about living life without hope and the mood changed from let me listen to Mr. Bungle to let me think about life stuff while those lentils finish cooking.</p><p>I once heard a very good statement - I go about my life using my own compass of what is right or wrong. What is right or wrong comes from the experiences I have had in life and how I think our society should work. That to me has been one of the best statements ever and I have tried to live by it.</p><p>So what really is the moral compass? The dictionary says - used in reference to a person&rsquo;s ability to judge what is right and wrong and act accordingly. There are many ways to do this. But how do you know your moral compass is correct?</p><p>If you ask people who share your values, your moral compass will always be pointing in the right direction. If you ask people who have different values, your moral compass will always be pointing in the wrong direction. Can you spot-check your own values every now and then to see if things are right or wrong? Probably. Like the compass Jack Sparrow used. Life experiences will teach you things that are right and wrong.</p><p>Unfortunately there is no easy way to calibrate your moral compass perfectly. But you can definitely make sure it&rsquo;s roughly pointing in the right direction. Being mindful, listening, doing things that do not harm or hurt others, appreciating the good, doing things that have been considered moral, etc. tend to push it in the right direction.</p><p>Oh my! The lentils are done. It&rsquo;s time to cook. Cheers!</p></div><footer></footer></article><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script><script type=text/javascript async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js></script><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/startup.js id=MathJax-script></script><script>MathJax={tex:{inlineMath:[['$','$'],['\\(','\\)']],processEscapes:true,processEnvironments:true},options:{skipHtmlTags:['script','noscript','style','textarea','pre']}};</script></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
