A couple of years ago I was finally able to get into audiophile grade equipment. It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic hobby especially if you enjoy music. Trust me, you can blow all your money on a pair of headphones if you choose to. Check out Sennheiser HE 1 and HIFIMAN Shangri-La.</description></item></channel></rss>
