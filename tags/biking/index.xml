I never told anyone or wrote about it because I have this feeling that when I say something about things I do or things I like, I somehow stop doing it. I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to put that silly thought aside and talk about this sport that I love. So yes, I do bike. I got into this addictive sport about 6 years ago thanks to Cadence90 in Bangalore, India.</description></item></channel></rss>
