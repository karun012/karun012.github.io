These are some of the principles I really like to follow -
Write tests before writing code unless there is no logic in your code. If no test then there should be no code. If you write the test after you write the code, you most likely will be testing what you coded and not what you intended to code Write clear, clean, and concise code that works no matter what Do not try to cure a global pandemic while writing a little feature.</description></item></channel></rss>
