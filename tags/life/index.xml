Covid! What a year this has been.
As Covid began to spread every company started going remote. At least the software ones did. Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked remotely for over 2.5 years back in 2015. This was across several timezones, too. So it was a little more complicated than what you&amp;rsquo;re probably doing right now. It also involved pair programming. Yeah, it was not simple at all. After a point I did start working regular hours and went solo.</description></item><item><title>My nine and a half commandments</title><link>https://www.onebucketsambaar.com/posts/nine-and-a-half-commandments/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Aug 2020 11:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.onebucketsambaar.com/posts/nine-and-a-half-commandments/</guid><description>In software engineering every little thing matters. These are some of the principles I really like to follow -
Write tests before writing code unless there is no logic in your code. If there is no test then there should be no code. If you write the test after you write the code, you most likely will be testing behavior and not what you intended to code Write clear, clean, and concise code that works no matter what Do not try to cure a global pandemic while writing a little feature.</description></item></channel></rss>
